Companies must be able to<br>demonstrate the access levels granted to individual staff members and ensure that historical<br>information regarding user access level is available. Where the system does not capture this data,<br>then a record must be maintained outside of the system. Access controls should be applied to both<br>the operating system and application levels. Individual login at operating system level may not be<br>required if appropriate controls are in place to ensure data integrity (e.g. no modification,<br>deletion or creation of data outside the application is possible). For systems generating, amending<br>or storing GXP data shared logins or generic user access should not be used. Where the computerised<br>system design supports individual user access, this function must be used. This may require the<br>purchase of additional licences. Systems (such as MRP systems) that are not used in their entirety<br>for GXP purposes but do have elements within them, such as approved suppliers, stock status,<br>location and transaction histories that are GXP applicable require appropriate assessment and<br>control. It is acknowledged that some computerised systems support only a single user login or<br>limited numbers of user logins. Where no suitable alternative computerised system is available,<br>equivalent control may be provided by third-party software or a paper-based method of providing<br>traceability (with version control). The suitability of alternative systems should be justified and<br>documented. Increased data review is likely to be required for hybrid systems because they are<br>vulnerable to non-attributable data changes.

The review of the raw electronic<br>data should mitigate risk and enable detection of data deletion, amendment, duplication, reusing and<br>fabrication which are common data integrity failures. Example of an inspection citing: Raw data for<br>HPLC/GC runs which had been invalidated was stored separately to the QC raw data packages and had<br>not been included in the review process. In the above situation, the procedure for review of<br>chromatographic data packages did not require a review of the electronic raw data or a review of<br>relevant audit trails associated with the analyses.

In the case of data generated from an electronic<br>system, electronic data is the original record which must be reviewed and evaluated prior to making<br>batch release decisions and other decisions relating to GMP related activities (e.g. approval of<br>stability results, analytical method validation etc.). In the event that the review is based solely<br>on printouts there is potential for records to be excluded from the review process which may contain<br>un-investigated out of specification data or other data anomalies. The review of the raw electronic<br>data should mitigate risk and enable detection of data deletion, amendment, duplication, reusing and<br>fabrication which are common data integrity failures. Example of an inspection citing: Raw data for<br>HPLC/GC runs which had been invalidated was stored separately to the QC raw data packages and had<br>not been included in the review process. In the above situation, the procedure for review of<br>chromatographic data packages did not require a review of the electronic raw data or a review of<br>relevant audit trails associated with the analyses.

Metadata are data about data that provide the contextual information required to<br>understand those data. These include structural and descriptive metadata.

Metadata necessary to evaluate the meaning of data should<br>be securely linked to the data and subject to adequate review. For example, in weighing, the number<br>8 is meaningless without metadata, i.e. the unit, mg.

To reduce the likelihood of<br>successful tampering and to increase the likelihood that consumers will discover if a product has<br>been tampered with, the package is required to be distinctive by design or by the use of one or more<br>indicators or barriers to entry that employ an identifying characteristic (e.g., a pattern, name,<br>registered trademark, logo, or picture). For purposes of this section, the term ‘‘distinctive by<br>design’’ means the packaging cannot be duplicated with commonly available materials or through<br>commonly available processes. A tamper-evident package may involve an immediate-container and<br>closure system or secondary-container or carton system or any combination of systems intended to<br>provide a visual indication of package integrity. The tamper-evident feature shall be designed to<br>and shall remain intact when handled in a reasonable manner during manufacture, distribution, and<br>retail display. (2) In addition to the tamper-evident packaging feature described in paragraph<br>(b)(1) of this section, any twopiece, hard gelatin capsule covered by this section must be sealed<br>using an acceptable tamper-evident technology",

           "Computerised system user access/system administrator roles Full use should be made of access<br>controls to ensure that people have access only to functionality that is appropriate for their job<br>role, and that actions are attributable to a specific individual. Companies must be able to<br>demonstrate the access levels granted to individual staff members and ensure that historical<br>information regarding user access level is available. Where the system does not capture this data,<br>then a record must be maintained outside of the system. Access controls should be applied to both<br>the operating system and application levels. Individual login at operating system level may not be<br>required if appropriate controls are in place to ensure data integrity (e.g. no modification,<br>deletion or creation of data outside the application is possible). For systems generating, amending<br>or storing GXP data shared logins or generic user access should not be used. Where the computerised<br>system design supports individual user access, this function must be used. This may require the<br>purchase of additional licences. Systems (such as MRP systems) that are not used in their entirety<br>for GXP purposes but do have elements within them, such as approved suppliers, stock status,<br>location and transaction histories that are GXP applicable require appropriate assessment and<br>control. It is acknowledged that some computerised systems support only a single user login or<br>limited numbers of user logins. Where no suitable alternative computerised system is available,<br>equivalent control may be provided by third-party software or a paper-based method of providing<br>traceability (with version control). The suitability of alternative systems should be justified and<br>documented. Increased data review is likely to be required for hybrid systems because they are<br>vulnerable to non-attributable data changes. It is expected that companies should be implementing<br>systems that comply with current regulatory expectations2. System administrator access should be<br>restricted to the minimum number of people possible taking account of the size and nature of the<br>organisation. The generic system administrator account should not be available for routine use.<br>Personnel with system administrator access should log in with unique credentials that allow actions<br>in the audit trail(s) to be attributed to a specific individual. The intent of this is to prevent<br>giving access to users with potentially a conflict of interest so that they can make unauthorised<br>changes that would not be traceable to that person. System Administrator rights (permitting<br>activities such as data deletion, database amendment or system configuration changes) should not be<br>assigned to individuals with a direct interest in the data (data generation, data review or<br>approval). Individuals may require changes in their access rights depending on the status of<br>clinical trial data.

In the case of data generated from an electronic<br>system, electronic data is the original record which must be reviewed and evaluated prior to making<br>batch release decisions and other decisions relating to GMP related activities (e.g. approval of<br>stability results, analytical method validation etc.).

The review of the raw electronic<br>data should mitigate risk and enable detection of data deletion, amendment, duplication, reusing and<br>fabrication which are common data integrity failures. Example of an inspection citing: Raw data for<br>HPLC/GC runs which had been invalidated was stored separately to the QC raw data packages and had<br>not been included in the review process. In the above situation, the procedure for review of<br>chromatographic data packages did not require a review of the electronic raw data or a review of<br>relevant audit trails associated with the analyses. This lead to the exclusion of records from the<br>review process and to lack of visibility of changes made during the processing and reporting of the<br>data.

Risk reduction focuses on processes for mitigation or avoidance of quality<br>risk when it exceeds a specified (acceptable) level (see Fig. 1).

Processes that improve the<br>detectability of hazards and quality risks might also be used as part of a risk control strategy.<br>The implementation of risk reduction measures can introduce new risks into the system or increase<br>the significance of other existing risks. Hence, it might be appropriate to revisit the risk<br>assessment to identify and evaluate any possible change in risk after implementing a risk reduction<br>process. Risk acceptance is a decision  to accept risk. Risk acceptance  can be a formal decision to<br>accept the residual risk or it can be a passive decision in which residual risks are not specified.<br>For some types of harms, even the best quality risk management practices might not entirely<br>eliminate risk. In these circumstances, it might be agreed that an appropriate quality risk<br>management strategy has been applied and that quality risk is reduced to a specified (acceptable)<br>level.

In the case of data generated from an electronic<br>system, electronic data is the original record which must be reviewed and evaluated prior to making<br>batch release decisions and other decisions relating to GMP related activities (e.g. approval of<br>stability results, analytical method validation etc.). In the event that the review is based solely<br>on printouts there is potential for records to be excluded from the review process which may contain<br>un-investigated out of specification data or other data anomalies. The review of the raw electronic<br>data should mitigate risk and enable detection of data deletion, amendment, duplication, reusing and<br>fabrication which are common data integrity failures. Example of an inspection citing: Raw data for<br>HPLC/GC runs which had been invalidated was stored separately to the QC raw data packages and had<br>not been included in the review process. In the above situation, the procedure for review of<br>chromatographic data packages did not require a review of the electronic raw data or a review of<br>relevant audit trails associated with the analyses. This lead to the exclusion of records from the<br>review process and to lack of visibility of changes made during the processing and reporting of the<br>data.

Metadata are data about data that provide the contextual information required to<br>understand those data. These include structural and descriptive metadata. Such data describe the<br>structure, data elements, interrelationships and other characteristics of data. They also permit<br>data to be attributable to an individual. Metadata necessary to evaluate the meaning of data should<br>be securely linked to the data and subject to adequate review. For example, in weighing, the number<br>8 is meaningless without metadata, i.e. the unit, mg.

Companies must be able to<br>demonstrate the access levels granted to individual staff members and ensure that historical<br>information regarding user access level is available. Where the system does not capture this data,<br>then a record must be maintained outside of the system. Access controls should be applied to both<br>the operating system and application levels.

For systems generating, amending<br>or storing GXP data shared logins or generic user access should not be used. Where the computerised<br>system design supports individual user access, this function must be used. This may require the<br>purchase of additional licences. Systems (such as MRP systems) that are not used in their entirety<br>for GXP purposes but do have elements within them, such as approved suppliers, stock status,<br>location and transaction histories that are GXP applicable require appropriate assessment and<br>control. It is acknowledged that some computerised systems support only a single user login or<br>limited numbers of user logins. Where no suitable alternative computerised system is available,<br>equivalent control may be provided by third-party software or a paper-based method of providing<br>traceability (with version control).

In the case of data generated from an electronic<br>system, electronic data is the original record which must be reviewed and evaluated prior to making<br>batch release decisions and other decisions relating to GMP related activities (e.g. approval of<br>stability results, analytical method validation etc.).

The review of the raw electronic<br>data should mitigate risk and enable detection of data deletion, amendment, duplication, reusing and<br>fabrication which are common data integrity failures. Example of an inspection citing: Raw data for<br>HPLC/GC runs which had been invalidated was stored separately to the QC raw data packages and had<br>not been included in the review process. In the above situation, the procedure for review of<br>chromatographic data packages did not require a review of the electronic raw data or a review of<br>relevant audit trails associated with the analyses. This lead to the exclusion of records from the<br>review process and to lack of visibility of changes made during the processing and reporting of the<br>data.

In the case of data generated from an electronic<br>system, electronic data is the original record which must be reviewed and evaluated prior to making<br>batch release decisions and other decisions relating to GMP related activities (e.g. approval of<br>stability results, analytical method validation etc.). In the event that the review is based solely<br>on printouts there is potential for records to be excluded from the review process which may contain<br>un-investigated out of specification data or other data anomalies. The review of the raw electronic<br>data should mitigate risk and enable detection of data deletion, amendment, duplication, reusing and<br>fabrication which are common data integrity failures. Example of an inspection citing: Raw data for<br>HPLC/GC runs which had been invalidated was stored separately to the QC raw data packages and had<br>not been included in the review process. In the above situation, the procedure for review of<br>chromatographic data packages did not require a review of the electronic raw data or a review of<br>relevant audit trails associated with the analyses.

Metadata are data about data that provide the contextual information required to<br>understand those data. These include structural and descriptive metadata.

Metadata necessary to evaluate the meaning of data should<br>be securely linked to the data and subject to adequate review. For example, in weighing, the number<br>8 is meaningless without metadata, i.e. the unit, mg.

Companies must be able to<br>demonstrate the access levels granted to individual staff members and ensure that historical<br>information regarding user access level is available. Where the system does not capture this data,<br>then a record must be maintained outside of the system. Access controls should be applied to both<br>the operating system and application levels. Individual login at operating system level may not be<br>required if appropriate controls are in place to ensure data integrity (e.g. no modification,<br>deletion or creation of data outside the application is possible). For systems generating, amending<br>or storing GXP data shared logins or generic user access should not be used. Where the computerised<br>system design supports individual user access, this function must be used. This may require the<br>purchase of additional licences. Systems (such as MRP systems) that are not used in their entirety<br>for GXP purposes but do have elements within them, such as approved suppliers, stock status,<br>location and transaction histories that are GXP applicable require appropriate assessment and<br>control. It is acknowledged that some computerised systems support only a single user login or<br>limited numbers of user logins. Where no suitable alternative computerised system is available,<br>equivalent control may be provided by third-party software or a paper-based method of providing<br>traceability (with version control). The suitability of alternative systems should be justified and<br>documented. Increased data review is likely to be required for hybrid systems because they are<br>vulnerable to non-attributable data changes. It is expected that companies should be implementing<br>systems that comply with current regulatory expectations2. System administrator access should be<br>restricted to the minimum number of people possible taking account of the size and nature of the<br>organisation. The generic system administrator account should not be available for routine use.<br>Personnel with system administrator access should log in with unique credentials that allow actions<br>in the audit trail(s) to be attributed to a specific individual. The intent of this is to prevent<br>giving access to users with potentially a conflict of interest so that they can make unauthorised<br>changes that would not be traceable to that person. System Administrator rights (permitting<br>activities such as data deletion, database amendment or system configuration changes) should not be<br>assigned to individuals with a direct interest in the data (data generation, data review or<br>approval). Individuals may require changes in their access rights depending on the status of<br>clinical trial data. For example, once data management processes are complete, the data is ‘locked’<br>by removing editing access rights. This should be able to be demonstrated within the system.",

In the case of data generated from an electronic<br>system, electronic data is the original record which must be reviewed and evaluated prior to making<br>batch release decisions and other decisions relating to GMP related activities (e.g. approval of<br>stability results, analytical method validation etc.). In the event that the review is based solely<br>on printouts there is potential for records to be excluded from the review process which may contain<br>un-investigated out of specification data or other data anomalies. The review of the raw electronic<br>data should mitigate risk and enable detection of data deletion, amendment, duplication, reusing and<br>fabrication which are common data integrity failures. Example of an inspection citing: Raw data for<br>HPLC/GC runs which had been invalidated was stored separately to the QC raw data packages and had<br>not been included in the review process. In the above situation, the procedure for review of<br>chromatographic data packages did not require a review of the electronic raw data or a review of<br>relevant audit trails associated with the analyses. This lead to the exclusion of records from the<br>review process and to lack of visibility of changes made during the processing and reporting of the<br>data.

The amount of effort used for risk control should be<br>proportional to the significance of the risk. Decision makers might use different processes,<br>including benefit-cost analysis, for understanding the optimal level of risk control.

Risk reduction focuses on processes for mitigation or avoidance of quality<br>risk when it exceeds a specified (acceptable) level (see Fig. 1). Risk reduction might include<br>actions taken to mitigate the severity and probability of harm. Processes that improve the<br>detectability of hazards and quality risks might also be used as part of a risk control strategy.<br>The implementation of risk reduction measures can introduce new risks into the system or increase<br>the significance of other existing risks. Hence, it might be appropriate to revisit the risk<br>assessment to identify and evaluate any possible change in risk after implementing a risk reduction<br>process. Risk acceptance is a decision  to accept risk. Risk acceptance  can be a formal decision to<br>accept the residual risk or it can be a passive decision in which residual risks are not specified.<br>For some types of harms, even the best quality risk management practices might not entirely<br>eliminate risk. In these circumstances, it might be agreed that an appropriate quality risk<br>management strategy has been applied and that quality risk is reduced to a specified (acceptable)<br>level.

In the case of data generated from an electronic<br>system, electronic data is the original record which must be reviewed and evaluated prior to making<br>batch release decisions and other decisions relating to GMP related activities (e.g. approval of<br>stability results, analytical method validation etc.). In the event that the review is based solely<br>on printouts there is potential for records to be excluded from the review process which may contain<br>un-investigated out of specification data or other data anomalies. The review of the raw electronic<br>data should mitigate risk and enable detection of data deletion, amendment, duplication, reusing and<br>fabrication which are common data integrity failures. Example of an inspection citing: Raw data for<br>HPLC/GC runs which had been invalidated was stored separately to the QC raw data packages and had<br>not been included in the review process. In the above situation, the procedure for review of<br>chromatographic data packages did not require a review of the electronic raw data or a review of<br>relevant audit trails associated with the analyses. This lead to the exclusion of records from the<br>review process and to lack of visibility of changes made during the processing and reporting of the<br>data.

Metadata are data about data that provide the contextual information required to<br>understand those data. These include structural and descriptive metadata. Such data describe the<br>structure, data elements, interrelationships and other characteristics of data. They also permit<br>data to be attributable to an individual. Metadata necessary to evaluate the meaning of data should<br>be securely linked to the data and subject to adequate review. For example, in weighing, the number<br>8 is meaningless without metadata, i.e. the unit, mg.

Companies must be able to<br>demonstrate the access levels granted to individual staff members and ensure that historical<br>information regarding user access level is available. Where the system does not capture this data,<br>then a record must be maintained outside of the system. Access controls should be applied to both<br>the operating system and application levels.

For systems generating, amending<br>or storing GXP data shared logins or generic user access should not be used. Where the computerised<br>system design supports individual user access, this function must be used. This may require the<br>purchase of additional licences. Systems (such as MRP systems) that are not used in their entirety<br>for GXP purposes but do have elements within them, such as approved suppliers, stock status,<br>location and transaction histories that are GXP applicable require appropriate assessment and<br>control. It is acknowledged that some computerised systems support only a single user login or<br>limited numbers of user logins. Where no suitable alternative computerised system is available,<br>equivalent control may be provided by third-party software or a paper-based method of providing<br>traceability (with version control).

In the case of data generated from an electronic<br>system, electronic data is the original record which must be reviewed and evaluated prior to making<br>batch release decisions and other decisions relating to GMP related activities (e.g. approval of<br>stability results, analytical method validation etc.).

The review of the raw electronic<br>data should mitigate risk and enable detection of data deletion, amendment, duplication, reusing and<br>fabrication which are common data integrity failures. Example of an inspection citing: Raw data for<br>HPLC/GC runs which had been invalidated was stored separately to the QC raw data packages and had<br>not been included in the review process. In the above situation, the procedure for review of<br>chromatographic data packages did not require a review of the electronic raw data or a review of<br>relevant audit trails associated with the analyses. This lead to the exclusion of records from the<br>review process and to lack of visibility of changes made during the processing and reporting of the<br>data.

In the case of data generated from an electronic<br>system, electronic data is the original record which must be reviewed and evaluated prior to making<br>batch release decisions and other decisions relating to GMP related activities (e.g. approval of<br>stability results, analytical method validation etc.). In the event that the review is based solely<br>on printouts there is potential for records to be excluded from the review process which may contain<br>un-investigated out of specification data or other data anomalies. The review of the raw electronic<br>data should mitigate risk and enable detection of data deletion, amendment, duplication, reusing and<br>fabrication which are common data integrity failures. Example of an inspection citing: Raw data for<br>HPLC/GC runs which had been invalidated was stored separately to the QC raw data packages and had<br>not been included in the review process. In the above situation, the procedure for review of<br>chromatographic data packages did not require a review of the electronic raw data or a review of<br>relevant audit trails associated with the analyses.

Metadata are data about data that provide the contextual information required to<br>understand those data. These include structural and descriptive metadata.

Metadata necessary to evaluate the meaning of data should<br>be securely linked to the data and subject to adequate review. For example, in weighing, the number<br>8 is meaningless without metadata, i.e. the unit, mg.

Companies must be able to<br>demonstrate the access levels granted to individual staff members and ensure that historical<br>information regarding user access level is available. Where the system does not capture this data,<br>then a record must be maintained outside of the system. Access controls should be applied to both<br>the operating system and application levels. Individual login at operating system level may not be<br>required if appropriate controls are in place to ensure data integrity (e.g. no modification,<br>deletion or creation of data outside the application is possible). For systems generating, amending<br>or storing GXP data shared logins or generic user access should not be used. Where the computerised<br>system design supports individual user access, this function must be used. This may require the<br>purchase of additional licences. Systems (such as MRP systems) that are not used in their entirety<br>for GXP purposes but do have elements within them, such as approved suppliers, stock status,<br>location and transaction histories that are GXP applicable require appropriate assessment and<br>control. It is acknowledged that some computerised systems support only a single user login or<br>limited numbers of user logins. Where no suitable alternative computerised system is available,<br>equivalent control may be provided by third-party software or a paper-based method of providing<br>traceability (with version control). The suitability of alternative systems should be justified and<br>documented. Increased data review is likely to be required for hybrid systems because they are<br>vulnerable to non-attributable data changes. It is expected that companies should be implementing<br>systems that comply with current regulatory expectations2. System administrator access should be<br>restricted to the minimum number of people possible taking account of the size and nature of the<br>organisation. The generic system administrator account should not be available for routine use.<br>Personnel with system administrator access should log in with unique credentials that allow actions<br>in the audit trail(s) to be attributed to a specific individual. The intent of this is to prevent<br>giving access to users with potentially a conflict of interest so that they can make unauthorised<br>changes that would not be traceable to that person. System Administrator rights (permitting<br>activities such as data deletion, database amendment or system configuration changes) should not be<br>assigned to individuals with a direct interest in the data (data generation, data review or<br>approval). Individuals may require changes in their access rights depending on the status of<br>clinical trial data. For example, once data management processes are complete, the data is ‘locked’<br>by removing editing access rights. This should be able to be demonstrated within the system.",

In the case of data generated from an electronic<br>system, electronic data is the original record which must be reviewed and evaluated prior to making<br>batch release decisions and other decisions relating to GMP related activities (e.g. approval of<br>stability results, analytical method validation etc.). In the event that the review is based solely<br>on printouts there is potential for records to be excluded from the review process which may contain<br>un-investigated out of specification data or other data anomalies. The review of the raw electronic<br>data should mitigate risk and enable detection of data deletion, amendment, duplication, reusing and<br>fabrication which are common data integrity failures. Example of an inspection citing: Raw data for<br>HPLC/GC runs which had been invalidated was stored separately to the QC raw data packages and had<br>not been included in the review process. In the above situation, the procedure for review of<br>chromatographic data packages did not require a review of the electronic raw data or a review of<br>relevant audit trails associated with the analyses. This lead to the exclusion of records from the<br>review process and to lack of visibility of changes made during the processing and reporting of the<br>data.

The amount of effort used for risk control should be<br>proportional to the significance of the risk. Decision makers might use different processes,<br>including benefit-cost analysis, for understanding the optimal level of risk control.

Risk reduction focuses on processes for mitigation or avoidance of quality<br>risk when it exceeds a specified (acceptable) level (see Fig. 1). Risk reduction might include<br>actions taken to mitigate the severity and probability of harm. Processes that improve the<br>detectability of hazards and quality risks might also be used as part of a risk control strategy.<br>The implementation of risk reduction measures can introduce new risks into the system or increase<br>the significance of other existing risks. Hence, it might be appropriate to revisit the risk<br>assessment to identify and evaluate any possible change in risk after implementing a risk reduction<br>process. Risk acceptance is a decision  to accept risk. Risk acceptance  can be a formal decision to<br>accept the residual risk or it can be a passive decision in which residual risks are not specified.<br>For some types of harms, even the best quality risk management practices might not entirely<br>eliminate risk. In these circumstances, it might be agreed that an appropriate quality risk<br>management strategy has been applied and that quality risk is reduced to a specified (acceptable)<br>level.

In the case of data generated from an electronic<br>system, electronic data is the original record which must be reviewed and evaluated prior to making<br>batch release decisions and other decisions relating to GMP related activities (e.g. approval of<br>stability results, analytical method validation etc.). In the event that the review is based solely<br>on printouts there is potential for records to be excluded from the review process which may contain<br>un-investigated out of specification data or other data anomalies. The review of the raw electronic<br>data should mitigate risk and enable detection of data deletion, amendment, duplication, reusing and<br>fabrication which are common data integrity failures. Example of an inspection citing: Raw data for<br>HPLC/GC runs which had been invalidated was stored separately to the QC raw data packages and had<br>not been included in the review process. In the above situation, the procedure for review of<br>chromatographic data packages did not require a review of the electronic raw data or a review of<br>relevant audit trails associated with the analyses. This lead to the exclusion of records from the<br>review process and to lack of visibility of changes made during the processing and reporting of the<br>data.

Metadata are data about data that provide the contextual information required to<br>understand those data. These include structural and descriptive metadata. Such data describe the<br>structure, data elements, interrelationships and other characteristics of data. They also permit<br>data to be attributable to an individual. Metadata necessary to evaluate the meaning of data should<br>be securely linked to the data and subject to adequate review. For example, in weighing, the number<br>8 is meaningless without metadata, i.e. the unit, mg.
