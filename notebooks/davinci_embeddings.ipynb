A<br>principal investigator, EC, or<br>regulatory authority may<br>suspend or prematurely<br>terminate participation in a<br>clinical investigation at the<br>investigation sites for which<br>they are responsible. If<br>suspicion of an unacceptable<br>risk to subjects arises during<br>the clinical investigation, or<br>when so instructed by the EC<br>or regulatory authorities, the<br>sponsor shall suspend the<br>clinical investigation while<br>the risk is assessed. The<br>sponsor shall terminate the<br>clinical investigation if an<br>unacceptable risk is<br>confirmed. The sponsor shall<br>consider terminating or<br>suspending the participation<br>of a particular investigation<br>site or investigator in the<br>clinical investigation if<br>monitoring or auditing<br>identifies serious or repeated<br>deviations on the part of an<br>investigator. If suspension or<br>premature termination occurs,<br>the terminating party shall<br>justify its decision in<br>writing and promptly inform<br>the other parties with whom<br>they are in direct<br>communication. The principal<br>investigator and sponsor shall<br>keep each other informed of<br>any communication received<br>from either the EC or the<br>regulatory authority.

If, for any reason,<br>the sponsor suspends or<br>prematurely terminates the<br>investigation at an individual<br>investigation site, the<br>sponsor shall inform the<br>responsible regulatory<br>authority as appropriate and<br>ensure that the EC is<br>notified, either by the<br>principal investigator or by<br>the sponsor. If the suspension<br>or premature termination was<br>in the interest of safety, the<br>sponsor shall inform all other<br>principal investigators. If<br>suspension or premature<br>termination occurs, a) the<br>sponsor shall remain<br>responsible for providing<br>resources to fulfil the<br>obligations from the CIP and<br>existing agreements for<br>following up the subjects<br>enrolled in the clinical<br>investigation, and b) the<br>principal investigator or<br>authorized designee shall<br>promptly inform the enrolled<br>subjects at his/her<br>investigation site, if<br>appropriate.

(II) High<br>risk of illegitimacy. A<br>manufacturer shall notify the<br>Secretary and immediate<br>trading partners that the<br>manufacturer has reason to<br>believe may have in the<br>trading partner's possession a<br>product manufactured by, or<br>purported to be a product<br>manufactured by, the<br>manufacturer not later than 24<br>hours after determining or<br>being notified by the<br>Secretary or a trading partner<br>that there is a high risk that<br>such product is an<br>illegitimate product. For<br>purposes of this subclause, a<br>`high risk' may include a<br>specific high risk that could<br>increase the likelihood  that<br>illegitimate product will<br>enter the pharmaceutical<br>distribution supply chain and<br>other high risks as determined<br>by the Secretary in guidance<br>pursuant to subsection (h).<br>(iii) Responding to a<br>notification. Upon the receipt<br>of a notification from the<br>Secretary or a trading partner<br>that a determination has been<br>made that a product is an<br>illegitimate product, a<br>manufacturer shall identify<br>all illegitimate product<br>subject to such notification<br>that is in the possession or<br>control of the manufacturer,<br>including any product that is<br>subsequently received, and<br>shall perform the activities<br>described in subparagraph (A).<br>(iv) Terminating a<br>notification. Upon making a<br>determination, in consultation<br>with the Secretary, that a<br>notification is no longer<br>necessary, a manufacturer<br>shall promptly notify<br>immediate trading partners<br>that the manufacturer notified<br>pursuant to clause (ii) that<br>such notification has been<br>terminated.<br>``(v) Records.--A manufacturer<br>shall keep records of the<br>disposition of an illegitimate<br>product for not less than 6<br>years after the conclusion of<br>the disposition."

In the case<br>of data generated from an<br>electronic system, electronic<br>data is the original record<br>which must be reviewed and<br>evaluated prior to making<br>batch release decisions and<br>other decisions relating to<br>GMP related activities (e.g.<br>approval of stability results,<br>analytical method validation<br>etc.). In the event that the<br>review is based solely on<br>printouts there is potential<br>for records to be excluded<br>from the review process which<br>may contain un-investigated<br>out of specification data or<br>other data anomalies. The<br>review of the raw electronic<br>data should mitigate risk and<br>enable detection of data<br>deletion, amendment,<br>duplication, reusing and<br>fabrication which are common<br>data integrity failures.<br>Example of an inspection<br>citing: Raw data for HPLC/GC<br>runs which had been<br>invalidated was stored<br>separately to the QC raw data<br>packages and had not been<br>included in the review<br>process. In the above<br>situation, the procedure for<br>review of chromatographic data<br>packages did not require a<br>review of the electronic raw<br>data or a review of relevant<br>audit trails associated with<br>the analyses. This lead to the<br>exclusion of records from the<br>review process and to lack of<br>visibility of changes made<br>during the processing and<br>reporting of the data. The<br>company was unable to provide<br>any explanation for the data<br>which had been invalidated."

Although there are<br>many other analytical<br>procedures, such as<br>dissolution testing for drug<br>products or particle size<br>determination for drug<br>substance, these have not been<br>addressed in the initial text<br>on validation of analytical<br>procedures. Validation of<br>these additional analytical<br>procedures is equally<br>important to those listed<br>herein and may be addressed in<br>subsequent documents. A brief<br>description of the types of<br>tests considered in this<br>document is provided below. •<br>Identification tests are<br>intended to ensure the<br>identity of an analyte in a<br>sample. This is normally<br>achieved by comparison of a<br>property of the sample (e.g.,<br>spectrum, chromatographic<br>behavior, chemical reactivity,<br>etc) to that of a reference<br>standard. • Testing for<br>impurities can be either a<br>quantitative test or a limit<br>test for the impurity in a<br>sample. Either test is<br>intended to accurately reflect<br>the purity characteristics of<br>the sample. Different<br>validation characteristics are<br>required for a quantitative<br>test than for a limit test. •<br>Assay procedures are intended<br>to measure the analyte present<br>in a given sample. In the<br>context of this document, the<br>assay represents a<br>quantitative measurement of<br>the major component(s) in the<br>drug substance. For the drug<br>product, similar validation<br>characteristics also apply<br>when assaying for the active<br>or other selected<br>component(s). The same<br>validation characteristics may<br>also apply to assays<br>associated with other<br>analytical procedures (e.g.,<br>dissolution)."
