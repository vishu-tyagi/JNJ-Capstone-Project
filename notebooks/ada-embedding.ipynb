Failure to maintain cybersecurity can result in compromised device functionality, loss of data (medical or personal) availability or integrity, or exposure of other connected devices or networks to security threats. This in turn may have the potential to result in patient illness, injury, or death.\nManufacturers should address cybersecurity during the design and development of the medical device, as this can result in more robust and efficient mitigation of patient risks.
