This comes from the quality principle that better results can be achieved by following a<br>methodical and rigorous plan for managing projects such as a plan-do-check-act approach. Product<br>planning includes the definition of phases, activities, responsibilities, and resources needed for<br>developing the SaMD. It is important to understand that planning is not static - it needs to be<br>updated when new information is gathered or milestones are reached. IMDRF/SaMD WG/N12 identifies<br>that for SaMD, a thorough understanding of the sociotechnical  environment (clinical perspective),<br>and the technology and system environment (software perspective) is important in planning, as<br>inadequate considerations could lead to incorrect, inaccurate, and/or delayed diagnoses and<br>treatments. The implementation of SaMD lifecycle processes should adequately be informed and<br>tailored for the type of SaMD as identified in IMDRF/SaMD WG/N12.  Example: Both companies carry out<br>product planning to decide which operating systems best suited their SaMD application. The larger<br>Magna company has chosen to build its application to work on the top five mobile phone operating<br>systems as the company has the resources to develop on multiple platforms. While the smaller Parva<br>has chosen to develop for the platform that is currently the market leader due to the company’s<br>constraints of resources. For both Parva and Magna, this planning phase can allow each company to<br>take deliberate approaches to the assignment of resources.

Considerations for the manufacturer when<br>identifying implications for safety and performance of SaMD: • The SaMD information security and<br>privacy control requirements may need to be balanced with the need for timely information<br>availability. • Information security requires the identification and implementation of safe (and<br>formalized) ways to store, convert and/or transmit data. • The design should use appropriate control<br>measures to address data integrity when common information is accessed by multiple applications and<br>users. • Manufacturers should make it feasible for users to safely implement information security<br>updates. • The protection of sensitive information requires support for sufficient access control<br>and appropriate restriction to system settings and assets for important data. • The design should<br>address possible adverse system interactions with the inclusion of appropriate resilience and<br>robustness measures. • Instructions for users related to information security should include how to<br>safely:   o Install SaMD in appropriate operating environments (e.g., OS, integration of other<br>software);   o Manage authentication mechanisms; and   o Update security software/spyware, operating<br>environments, and other systems and applications, etc.",

This comes from the quality principle that better results can be achieved by following a<br>methodical and rigorous plan for managing projects such as a plan-do-check-act approach. Product<br>planning includes the definition of phases, activities, responsibilities, and resources needed for<br>developing the SaMD. It is important to understand that planning is not static - it needs to be<br>updated when new information is gathered or milestones are reached. IMDRF/SaMD WG/N12 identifies<br>that for SaMD, a thorough understanding of the sociotechnical  environment (clinical perspective),<br>and the technology and system environment (software perspective) is important in planning, as<br>inadequate considerations could lead to incorrect, inaccurate, and/or delayed diagnoses and<br>treatments. The implementation of SaMD lifecycle processes should adequately be informed and<br>tailored for the type of SaMD as identified in IMDRF/SaMD WG/N12.  Example: Both companies carry out<br>product planning to decide which operating systems best suited their SaMD application. The larger<br>Magna company has chosen to build its application to work on the top five mobile phone operating<br>systems as the company has the resources to develop on multiple platforms. While the smaller Parva<br>has chosen to develop for the platform that is currently the market leader due to the company’s<br>constraints of resources. For both Parva and Magna, this planning phase can allow each company to<br>take deliberate approaches to the assignment of resources.

Considerations for the manufacturer when<br>identifying implications for safety and performance of SaMD: • The SaMD information security and<br>privacy control requirements may need to be balanced with the need for timely information<br>availability. • Information security requires the identification and implementation of safe (and<br>formalized) ways to store, convert and/or transmit data. • The design should use appropriate control<br>measures to address data integrity when common information is accessed by multiple applications and<br>users. • Manufacturers should make it feasible for users to safely implement information security<br>updates. • The protection of sensitive information requires support for sufficient access control<br>and appropriate restriction to system settings and assets for important data. • The design should<br>address possible adverse system interactions with the inclusion of appropriate resilience and<br>robustness measures. • Instructions for users related to information security should include how to<br>safely:   o Install SaMD in appropriate operating environments (e.g., OS, integration of other<br>software);   o Manage authentication mechanisms; and   o Update security software/spyware, operating<br>environments, and other systems and applications, etc.",

Product<br>planning includes the definition of phases, activities, responsibilities, and resources needed for<br>developing the SaMD. It is important to understand that planning is not static - it needs to be<br>updated when new information is gathered or milestones are reached. IMDRF/SaMD WG/N12 identifies<br>that for SaMD, a thorough understanding of the sociotechnical  environment (clinical perspective),<br>and the technology and system environment (software perspective) is important in planning, as<br>inadequate considerations could lead to incorrect, inaccurate, and/or delayed diagnoses and<br>treatments. The implementation of SaMD lifecycle processes should adequately be informed and<br>tailored for the type of SaMD as identified in IMDRF/SaMD WG/N12.  Example: Both companies carry out<br>product planning to decide which operating systems best suited their SaMD application. The larger<br>Magna company has chosen to build its application to work on the top five mobile phone operating<br>systems as the company has the resources to develop on multiple platforms. While the smaller Parva<br>has chosen to develop for the platform that is currently the market leader due to the company’s<br>constraints of resources. For both Parva and Magna, this planning phase can allow each company to<br>take deliberate approaches to the assignment of resources.

Considerations for the manufacturer when<br>identifying implications for safety and performance of SaMD: • The SaMD information security and<br>privacy control requirements may need to be balanced with the need for timely information<br>availability. • Information security requires the identification and implementation of safe (and<br>formalized) ways to store, convert and/or transmit data. • The design should use appropriate control<br>measures to address data integrity when common information is accessed by multiple applications and<br>users. • Manufacturers should make it feasible for users to safely implement information security<br>updates. • The protection of sensitive information requires support for sufficient access control<br>and appropriate restriction to system settings and assets for important data. • The design should<br>address possible adverse system interactions with the inclusion of appropriate resilience and<br>robustness measures. • Instructions for users related to information security should include how to<br>safely:   o Install SaMD in appropriate operating environments (e.g., OS, integration of other<br>software);   o Manage authentication mechanisms; and   o Update security software/spyware, operating<br>environments, and other systems and applications, etc.",

Product<br>planning includes the definition of phases, activities, responsibilities, and resources needed for<br>developing the SaMD. It is important to understand that planning is not static - it needs to be<br>updated when new information is gathered or milestones are reached. IMDRF/SaMD WG/N12 identifies<br>that for SaMD, a thorough understanding of the sociotechnical  environment (clinical perspective),<br>and the technology and system environment (software perspective) is important in planning, as<br>inadequate considerations could lead to incorrect, inaccurate, and/or delayed diagnoses and<br>treatments. The implementation of SaMD lifecycle processes should adequately be informed and<br>tailored for the type of SaMD as identified in IMDRF/SaMD WG/N12.  Example: Both companies carry out<br>product planning to decide which operating systems best suited their SaMD application. The larger<br>Magna company has chosen to build its application to work on the top five mobile phone operating<br>systems as the company has the resources to develop on multiple platforms. While the smaller Parva<br>has chosen to develop for the platform that is currently the market leader due to the company’s<br>constraints of resources. For both Parva and Magna, this planning phase can allow each company to<br>take deliberate approaches to the assignment of resources.

Considerations for the manufacturer when<br>identifying implications for safety and performance of SaMD: • The SaMD information security and<br>privacy control requirements may need to be balanced with the need for timely information<br>availability. • Information security requires the identification and implementation of safe (and<br>formalized) ways to store, convert and/or transmit data. • The design should use appropriate control<br>measures to address data integrity when common information is accessed by multiple applications and<br>users. • Manufacturers should make it feasible for users to safely implement information security<br>updates. • The protection of sensitive information requires support for sufficient access control<br>and appropriate restriction to system settings and assets for important data. • The design should<br>address possible adverse system interactions with the inclusion of appropriate resilience and<br>robustness measures. • Instructions for users related to information security should include how to<br>safely:   o Install SaMD in appropriate operating environments (e.g., OS, integration of other<br>software);   o Manage authentication mechanisms; and   o Update security software/spyware, operating<br>environments, and other systems and applications, etc.",
